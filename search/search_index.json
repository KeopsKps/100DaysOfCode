But before I continue with day 1, I would like to share with you 2 things: Who I am? What is my plan for this challenge? Who I am? My name is Christhofer Gutierrez, I'm from Nicaragua, that's located in Central America and I work as web developer. I'm passionate about software development and data science (data engineering, data analytics and machine learning engineering.) In order to be a good \"Software Developer\" or \"Data Scientist\" you have to fully understand the foundations of those disciplines, this requires us to spend a lot of time reading and understanding the logic behind them. However, as the old saying goes, practice makes perfect, and the only way you can fully understand those disciplines is to practice, practice and more practice and that's why I decided to start with this challenge. What is my plan for this challenge? What I described in the introduction is the final learning goal I set for this challenge, however they are more advanced topics that require a solid foundation of both programming languages: Python and Javascript. mkdocs.yml # The configuration file. docs/ index.md # The documentation homepage. ... # Other markdown pages, images and other files.","title":"Introduction"},{"location":"#introduction","text":"This documentation site will be used as a record of all the things I will learn in the #100DaysOfCode challenge, which will be mainly focused on building my skills as a Full Stack developer with Python (Django, FastAPI) and Javascript (React, Node) I will create a full documentation of all the things I'll build, including the steps and the plan for the solution.
