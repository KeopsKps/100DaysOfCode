But before I continue with day 1, I would like to share with you 2 things: Who I am? What is my plan for this challenge? Who I am? My name is Christhofer Gutierrez, I'm from Nicaragua, that's located in Central America and I work as web developer. I'm passionate about software development and data science (data engineering, data analytics and machine learning engineering.) In order to be a good Software Developer or Data Scientist you have to fully understand the foundations of those disciplines, this requires us to spend a lot of time reading and understanding the logic behind them. However, as the old saying goes, practice makes perfect, and the only way you can fully understand those disciplines is to practice, practice and more practice and that's why I decided to start with this challenge. What is my plan for this challenge? What I described in the introduction is the final learning goal I set for this challenge, however they are more advanced topics that require a solid foundation of both programming languages: Python and Javascript. The primary purpose of the #100DaysOfCode challenge is to build the skills in a given technology, it is commonly used to teach web development from scratch, but it can be adapted to learn anything, in this case it will be used to learn the advanced topics in Javascript (React and Node) and Python (Django and FastAPI). I start this challenge with a solid foundation in Python and basic knowledge in HTML, CSS and Javascript, this is my plan looking forward to start my challenge: CSS Flexbox CSS Grid Media Queries Bootstrap Javascript Types, Values and Variables Expressions and Operators Statements Objects Arrays Javascript engine Functions Classes Modules Javascript Standard Library Iterators and Generators Asynchronous Javascript ... Python Build Projects to reinforce the language Django FastAPI The are more topics that will be covered in the 100DaysOfCode challenge and this is just a reference of the learning path.","title":"Introduction"},{"location":"#introduction","text":"This documentation site will be used as a record of all the things I will learn in the #100DaysOfCode challenge, which will be mainly focused on building my skills as a Full Stack developer with Python (Django, FastAPI) and Javascript (React, Node) I will create a full documentation of all the things I'll build, including the steps and the plan for the solution.
